def register_recipe_assets(

) -> None:
    """
    Registers asset cards located under the specified path, relative to the
    calling moduleâ€™s path (i.e. ``module.__path__``).

    The specified path should be either a YAML file or a directory containing
    YAML files. If a directory is specified, it will be scanned recursively.
    Each YAML file must define one or more asset cards, which are used by
    :class:`AssetStore` to represent assets such as models, datasets, and
    tokenizers.

    Check out the :doc:`/concepts/assets` concept documentation to learn more
    about assets and asset cards.

    This function is intended to be called within the :meth:`~register` method
    of a recipe, to register assets that should always be available alongside
    the recipe.

    .. code:: python

        from fairseq2.runtime.dependency import DependencyContainer
        from fairseq2.recipe import TrainRecipe
        from fairseq2.recipe.composition import register_recipe_assets

        class MyRecipe(TrainRecipe):
            def register(self, container: DependencyContainer) -> None:
                register_recipe_assets(container, "configs/assets")

    ``stack_level`` can be used to specify the actual calling module. For
    example, if ``register_recipe_assets`` is invoked within a wrapper helper
    function, setting ``stack_level`` to 2 indicates that the caller module is
    the one that called the helper function.

            register_recipe_assets(container, "path/to/assets", stack_level=2)

    Note that this function is primarily intended for use by recipe authors.
    Users of a recipe can specify additional paths to search for asset cards by
    using the :attr:`AssetsConfig.extra_paths` configuration option.
