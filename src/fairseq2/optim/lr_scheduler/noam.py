    This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first
    :math:`T_{warmup}` training steps, and decreasing it thereafter
    proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. In the paper,
    the authors use the square root of the dimensionality of the model as
    :math:`\\eta_{base}`.

    This scheduler is commonly referred to as Noam, after the second author of
    the paper, Noam Shazeer.

        This scheduler is not chainable.
