    """
    Loads a pretrained model from an asset card.

    This function downloads the model checkpoint (if necessary) and loads the
    pretrained weights into a model instance. The model architecture and
    configuration are determined from the asset card metadata.

    As a convenience, this method also accepts an asset name instead of an
    asset card.

    The difference between ``load_model`` and :meth:`ModelHub.load_model()` is
    as follows:

    - ``load_model`` provides a unified interface for loading models across all
      model families. It determines the appropriate model family based on asset
      card metadata and delegates to the family-specific loading logic.
    - The tradeoff is that (1) the ``config`` parameter of ``load_model`` is not
      type-safe, (2) it is possible to accidentally load an unintended model
      since the function is not constrained to a specific family.
    - The general recommendation is to use :meth:`ModelHub.load_model` if the
      model family is known in advance, and to use ``load_model`` if the decision
      about the model and its family needs to be made at runtime.

    If ``gangs`` is provided, it will be used to apply parallelism (i.e.
    model parallelism) to the initialized model. If the model family does
    not support a certain parallelism strategy, that strategy will be
    ignored. For instance if ``gangs.tp.size > 1``, but the model does not
    support tensor parallelism, the model will be instantiated with regular
    attention and feed-forward network blocks. If ``None``, the whole model
    will be initialized without any parallelism.

    If ``device`` is provided, the model will be created on the specified
    device; otherwise, the device returned from :func:`torch.get_default_device`
    will be used. Note that ``device`` and ``gangs`` cannot be provided
    together. If ``gangs`` is provided, ``gangs.root.device`` will be used.

    If ``dtype`` is provided, it will be used as the default data type of
    the model parameters and buffers; otherwise, the data type returned from
    :func:`torch.get_default_dtype` will be used.

    If ``config`` is provided, it overrides the default model configuration
    from the asset card. If ``None``, uses the configuration specified in
    the card. Typically used to perform slight adjustments to the model
    configuration such as tuning dropout probabilities without changing the
    architecture.

    If ``mmap`` is ``True``, the model checkpoint will be memory-mapped. This
    can reduce memory usage but may cause slower load times on some systems.

    If ``progress`` is ``True``, displays a progress bar during model
    download and loading.
